## Introduction

This program is designed to be an aid to solving crossword or code cracker puzzles. For example, if you know a word is 11 letters in length and starts and ends with the letter "w", then the program will show that the only word to meets this criteria is "wheelbarrow".

The program uses the tkinter GUI. Radio buttons are placed into two lists. The index of the list is used to point to specific buttons. The selection from one group of radio buttons is passed to the selected button in the other group. 

A dictionary of English words is used. Based on a given word length and using the main buttons with characters inserted as filters, all words that match are displayed. Statistics on the number of words that match and the duration taken are displayed.
