## Introduction

This program will locate prime numbers by searching through a range of numbers in which the user may provide the start integer and select from a list the range of numbers to search. The algorithm used to determe if an integer is a prime is also selectable. Four algorithms are provided. Some algorithms are more efficient than others and as the program executes the elapsed time and a progress bar are displayed as a way of measuring the efficiency of the selected algorithm.

The menu bar contains a Help feature which opens another window and displays information in a scrolled text widget. A button provides for selecting either one of four text files of information to be displayed. 

As well as the main base module of tkinter for python3, four other modules from the tkinter package are used. These are themed tkinter (ttk), scrolledtext, messagebox and filedialog.

Setting the font type and font size make use of the style capabilities of themed tkinter. The geometry manager used is the grid method.

The program requires its four text files to reside in the same folder as the program in order to provide the help and other information.
